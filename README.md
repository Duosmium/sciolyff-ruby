# Science Olympiad File Formats

We propose standardized file formats for Science Olympiad scoring to allow for a
more universal record of tournament results and thus make it easier to do
sabermetric-like stats and stuff. The formats are a subset of YAML for easy
implementation of parsers across many programming languages.
